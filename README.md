# Remote

Remote is a highly decoupled/isolated and testable networking layer written in Swift.

## Architecture Design

Current version is based upon the network architecture design described in:

- Atlas networking layer: [link](https://medium.com/iquii/atlas-an-unified-approach-to-mobile-development-cycle-networking-layer-a5ccb064181a)
- The complete guide to Network Unit Testing in Swift: [link](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/the-complete-guide-to-network-unit-testing-in-swift-db8b3ee2c327)
- Network Layers in Swift: [link](http://danielemargutti.com/2017/09/10/how-to-write-networking-layer-in-swift-2nd-version/)
- Ultimate Guide to JSON Parsing with Swift 4: [link](https://benscheirman.com/2017/06/swift-json/)
- Under the hood of Futures & Promises in Swift [link](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/under-the-hood-of-futures-and-promises-in-swift)

## Used Libraries

In order to give a complete out-of-box approach Iâ€™ve used the following libraries:

* **Reactive Programming in Swift**: As a callback hell solution [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift)
* **Realm**: Caching [realm.io](https://realm.io)

## Installation
You can install Swiftline using CocoaPods, carthage and Swift package manager

### CocoaPods

```
